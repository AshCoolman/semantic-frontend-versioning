# Semantic frontend versioning

This project is to see what a semver-like versioning system for front-end projects would look like

## Aim

To describe the amount of difference/complexity between different versions
To exist along side Semver if it is used

## Rules

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you add a new problem domain solution (e.g. new site page)
* MINOR version when you add a feature an existing problem domain (e.g. add control to admin page, )
* PATCH version when you make feature tweaks, bug fixes, style or text changes (e.g. change css rules)

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata could mirror Semver when appropriate
